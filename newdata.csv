Teardrops,Bring Me the Horizon,POST HUMAN SURVIVAL HORROR,2020,tester,"We hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna know

Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

I'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming down
And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels
To be alone

So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

Suicidal, violent tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

Overrated,LANDMVRKS,Lost in the Waves,2022,tester,"Time to watch it burn! There's something wrong in me Ain't got another chance I never wanted this I'm screaming on the inside, about to suffocate The smoke is getting thick I don't know why I wasted so much time This life is overrated, I try to find my way back to (you) You make things complicated So lost and isolated, I found you trembling in my room Is this so hard to make it through? Trying to find a way The fire is getting higher I'm starting to run out of air and my tongue is bitter It will not be my grave I've got another feeling I can see shadows on the walls Everything is fading It'll no longer be the place we used to know and The man I used to be It'll no longer be the place we used to know and The man I used to be This place is trying to drag me down I'm gonna watch it burn This life is overrated, I try to find my way back to (you) You make things complicated So lost and isolated, I found you trembling in my room Is this so hard to make it through? Cause everything has to change But stories stay the same Spray it all with kerosene Up in smoke, I can feel my body smothering Spray it all with kerosene Up in smoke it won't drag me down I don't feel the pain at all No the fire won't drag me down Spray it all with kerosene Up in smoke, I can feel my body smothering Spray it all with kerosene Up in smoke, I can feel my body smothering This life is overrated, I try to find my way back to This life is overrated, I found you trembling in my room I see the flames and my tongue is bitter It's no longer the place we used to know!",0
Overrated,Thriving Ivory,Thriving Ivory,2008,tester,"She makes herself at home
God it's better than her place
She loves the little things
God we all need something

She swears this life is often overrated

Wont see her in the movies
Ain't no Marilyn Monroe
She calls herself Maria
Because she likes the name

She swears this life is often overrated
She can't relate to a world that only knows her by her face
Is here anyone still breathing?
And she thinks that I'm the one that makes it rain

She never cared for reason
And no religion at all
She said it makes her feel unsteady
Without a god to blame

She swears this life is often overrated
She can't relate to a world that only knows her by her face
Is there anyone still breathing?
And she thinks that I'm the one that makes it rain",0
