And after a while, you can work on points for style Like the club tie, and the firm handshake A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to So that when they turn their backs on you You'll get the chance to put the knife in. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south Hide your head in the sand Just another sad old man All alone and dying of cancer. And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone Dragged down by the stone. I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?

High Hopes,Pink Floyd,The Division Bell,1994,cyf,Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the division bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before time took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There's a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we've been so many times The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river Forever and ever,8

Wounds,Adept,Sleepless,2016,tml,"Sing from the heart, Let them hear what our love is made of. My heart's afflicted, everywhere I turn it reminds me of you. How we could write our headlines and make the world spin just for us? But we are not in motion, Everything I feel is tied to our past.

Dark Clouds,Adept,Sleepless,2016,tml,I will keep you alive. Dark clouds above you. Soaring on the sky like the breath of our dying days. I know this world can spin you around Faster than your heart can stand its ground. You always had the world on your shoulders. And above you carried the clouds. But you can't keep your head under water And still expect us to hear your despair. Here my voice through the discord. Breathe in. Breathe out. Even though it hurts on the inside. I know that here at the end of the road Your love will shine on. Chin up. Stay strong. Never let the world tell you wrong. I know that here at the end of the road. Your spark will shine through. The fluids in your lungs weigh you down like an anchor of death. You most reach up for the surface. I know this world has darkened you. Carry on the light in your eyes. I will guide you back. You are not alone. The sound of your innocence drowns tonight. Let it immerse to the discord. The surface of life will reflect our lights. It's the essence for bringing you back. As the water fill your lungs with despair you sink to a bottomless hole of depression. The choirs of chastity sings your name but beneath the surface you can not hear. And I know it's hard to look up when the world stares you back. But if you follow the sound of absolution you'll find your feet on a solid ground. I will sweep my arms around you and keep you safe for as long as you need me to. And as your heavy heart sinks to the bottom I know that life will lead the way. Life will guide you home. Breathe in. Breathe out. Even though it hurts on the inside. I know that here at the end of the road Our love will shine on. Chin up. Stay strong. Never let the world tell you wrong. I know that here at the end of the road. Your spark will shine through. Don't speak a word of you letting go. Cause I know you will make it through. Don't close the light that will carry you. Cause I know you will make it through. Breathe in. Breathe out.,2

(We said we would never give in) Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about trust. I feel it slipping away. Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about love. It's all slipping away We fought the battles and obstacles in our way. But this struggle seems to get the best of us. So we lost the only thing that mattered in the end. This friendship is slipping away It seems the we're only chasing after the hopes and the dreams we had. We don't trust ourselves in the present. So we linger on. You were, you were the beginning, you were the end You were, you were my everything You were, you were the beginning, you were the end You were, you were my everything Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about trust. I feel it slipping away. (Forever) Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about love. (Forever) is all slipping away (Forever, isn't long enough)",6
The Ivory Tower,Adept,Death Dealers,2011,tml,"We are lost on the sea of mystery And when the night is getting darker See a light it might just get us out alive One by one they've torn our dreams apart! One last time they say they tainted mine When empty oceans at souls We will sing from the top of our voices We are the sun and the sea and the mountain We are the children who still can believe We have faith we have hope we have answers In our heart is where we are free So stand alone in the ash of the shadow We can't deny within the dream shallow through We will guide you and the days where you feel lost So after all this shit you're mine I see the others staring back It seems to me that the only way to get through this tonight Is with hope and building dreams So make believe that we'll build it up brick by fucking brick This world wont tear us down Listen up young hearts this world is your Don't stop believing, don't yell scared Have faith in yourself and I'll promise That these anchors won't pull us down We are the sun and the sea and the mountain We are the children who still can believe We have faith we have hope we have answers In our heart is where we are free! Just save yourself. Just save yourself.",7
From the Depths of Hell,Adept,Death Dealers,2011,tml,"Right before my face the colors of the world fades away. We are walking around like ghosts and I am overwhelmed by the feeling of hopelessness. A desperation settles in. And all I want is for you to be proud of me. Your hand is slipping out of mine. 'Cause all I want is for you to be proud of me. A comfort I use to take for granted I dry my eyes with the knowledge that I did what I could bare. This is a song for the young believers. A dedication to the keepers of the faith. You make this choice if your in this to win it. A dedication to the keepers of the faith. I hold on to this memory that you had high hopes on me. I know you don't, you don't. I feel the cold surrounding me. You're just letting me down. This is a song for the young believers. A dedication to the keepers of the faith. You make this choice if your in this to win it. A dedication to the keepers of the faith. I'll catch the sun and bring it down for you if it's you makes you warmer (makes you warmer). So now you know that I'm back on my feet just to show you that I made myself a life that you could be proud of and I wish that you could be there just to see me again on the stage tonight singing songs in your name. It's all in your name! I scream my lungs out each night for a chance that you'll hear me. But you never could hear me enough I see a thousands other faces tonight but no one recall your beautiful judging eyes.",8
This Ends Tonight,Adept,Death Dealers,2011,tml,"Don't speak a word! You make more sense to me, with your mouth sewn shut! I've been waiting for your move. I can taste your weakness. I can feel your fear. In this moment of truth, all hell will break lose. That's right motherfuckers, lets get shit poppin'! I staring out the window I see the sun give another day. But I don't feel anything, I just don't feel a fucking thing. There's nothing left to strive for, there's nothing left to win. I don't believe in anything, I don't believe in anyone. Just give me something to breathe, something to fill these lungs with. Who will cure me now? There's no tomorrow ahead that will bring me to shore. This ain't the way I imagined the world would it turn into? A black hole, a abyss, A place where the light only shines on the fortunate ones Where is your heart at? When the sundown fades away? This is the sound of burning bridges. How could I ever be a part of this? Your treachery eyes won't pierce me again. This is the sound of burning bridges. This is the end of our days, the end of it all. This ain't the way I imagined the world would it turn into? A black hole, a abyss, A place where the light only shines on the fortunate ones. Where will you be? Where will you be? You said you would die for me. I believed every word you said. You said you would die for me. So what are you waiting for?! Your wear my heart on your sleeve with a smile on your face pretending you know me well. I guess this is the time I supposed to say I'm sorry? Your wear my heart on your sleeve with a gun in your hand and loaded it up with hopes. I guess this is the time I supposed to say I'm sorry? So fucking fire your gun at me! Your bullets pierce through me. I'm down on my knees. Spitting the blood, shutting my eyes I never would thought you had this in you! Fire your gun, pierce me with hope, With my last final breathe I forgive you for everything!",9
